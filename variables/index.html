                    <h3>What is a variable?</h3>
                    <p class="fragment fade-in">A variable is a bit of code that acts as a stand-in for a value you get later or that you need to use many times</p>
                    <p class="fragment fade-in">Think of it like a game of mad libs. You pick a few nouns, a verb or two, and an adjective and fill them in throughout a text. The words you choose are variables</p>

                    <h3>What is a data type?</h3>
                    <p class="fragment fade-in">Data types are ways to organize your data. Java is a "Strongly typed" language, so you have to specify what your data is when you declare the variable</p>
                    <p class="fragment fade-in">When you declare something like</p>
                    <pre>int numBooks = 0</pre>
                    <p class="fragment fade-in">you're creating a variable of the integer datatype with a value of zero</p>

                            I'm not sure what your class is going to cover, so I'll cover the basics.

                        <p class="fragment fade-in">There's the integer data type. This can be all whole numbers between -2^31 and 2^31-1.</p>
                        <p class="fragment fade-in">There's the double data type. This is all numbers, including decimals. There are limits, but you don't care about those right now</p>

                        String data types are used whenever you need text or something in text form. You'll use a lot of these, some make sure you're familliar with them.
                        When typing in  a string and using them in output statements, make sure you're familliar with where your spaces need to be. "thing " and "thing" will have differing results in output statements.
